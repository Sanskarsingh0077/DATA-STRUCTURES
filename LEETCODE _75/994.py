        Approach:

        Step 1: Initialize
            •	Loop through the grid.
            •	Count all fresh oranges.
            •	Add the positions of all rotten oranges to a queue (to perform BFS).

        Step 2: Perform BFS
            •	While the queue is not empty:
            •	Process all rotten oranges in the current queue (current minute).
            •	For each, check 4 directions (up/down/left/right).
            •	If a neighbor is a fresh orange (1), rot it (2) and add it to the queue.
            •	Decrease the fresh count.
            •	After each level, increment the minutes counter.

        Step 3: Return the Result
            •	If fresh == 0, return minutes - 1 (because the last increment is extra after the final rot).
            •	If fresh > 0, return -1 (some fresh oranges were unreachable).
        
        	•	Time: O(n × m)
	        •	Space: O(n × m) – worst-case for the queue
